introduction:

please post any comments/questions/advice on psc

i will be running a server for this game on my computer from August 7 to August 14 2002 24h a day (subject to change according to populairity of game)
the server may be down from 12:00am to 2:00pm eastern time when it will not be monitored
this is not a guarantee because to make sure the server is running i have to be there and play because there has to be at leat 2 people connected at a time
although im a programmer i do have a life so i cant be at my computer monitoring the server/playing for 24h a day


to connect to my server you must connect to my ip 65.95.12.166 
i hope u will play on my server i would like to see if there are still any bug/problems and just to have some fun


for server/game information/questions you can email me at olavjordan@hotmail.com (please no spam)


game information:

character can not be moved unless there are at least 2 people playing
to buy items select buy from the file menu or wait 
every one minute the buy window comes up and the game is paused

commands
	esc:		disconnect from server
	up arrow:	move character direction they are facing
	down arrow:	move character away from direction they are facing
	right arrow:	turn character 90 degrees to the right
	left arrow:	turn character 90 degrees to the left
	home:		move character to character's left
	pgup:		move character to character's right
	enter/return:	turn shields on if character has any
	space:		character shoots currently selected gun
	ctrl:		character selects next gun
	1:		character selects first gun
	2:		character selects shot gun
	3:		character selects machine gun
	
info
	shotgun 		= high powered gun shoot a bit faster than standard gun
	Sub Machine Gun 	= mid powered gun that can be shot repeadedly with little intervals in between and move faster
	Shields			= provides invincibility for a limited time
	health			= amount of damage able to sustain before death
	lives			= number of lives
	armour			= factor involved in amount of health lost when shot
	rocket			= speeds up character motion

the game is never won or lost it continues as long as there are people playing

in theory warbotz should be able to have 32767 or 50 (ive heard both and im really not sure) people play at a time but in practice the server is 
unstable at 5 people but i have not tried to crash my server and it seems to run fine for 3 people

this is warbotz version 2.0 version 1.0 was not posted on psc

and although it is cleche on psc "if you like my program please vote for it" ***** is best

if there is enough interest in my game i will make another release

for my next release i hope to have different items (ideas are welcome), multi thread my server for performance issues,
use the winsock api instead of controls, and maybe make it in c++ instead of vb

ps. I AM NOT A HACKER out to get people's ip addresses
    i take no responsibility for what could happen if you connect to anybody else who may be running a server
    and again for good measure "if you like my program please vote for it" :)
